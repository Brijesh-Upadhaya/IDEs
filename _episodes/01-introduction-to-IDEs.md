# Introduction to IDEs

In this lesson main concepts of IDE will be explained. One will also learn about the benefits and motivation to start using it. The main goal is to provide basic understanding of what IDEs are and which features they might contain, the goal is supported by a IDE-specific hands-on exercises later on.
Secondary goal is pointing out the variety of the tools available.

##  What is an IDE?

keyword: **INTEGRATED**

IDE stands for "Integrated Development Environment" - is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development (Wikipedia). There are plenty of software that are IDEs and alikes. However, there is [no defined terminator](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-notepad-plus-plus-for-developers/welcome) between a text editor and the IDE. 

Some examples of the text editing Universe:
- editors: proudly [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) and the legendary [vi](http://ex-vi.sourceforge.net/), his , no less famous [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) _etc._ that with some amount of skill and knowledge can be turned into cool custom IDE-like software complexes, or not. Their main benefits could be simplicity, extendability and wide use (vi editor is by standard the default text editor for UNIX systems)

- so called IDEs (containing additional to editing functionalities out of box): [Spyder](https://pythonhosted.org/spyder/), [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), [Ninja-IDE](http://ninja-ide.org/), [Pyzo](http://www.pyzo.org/); [VisualStudio](https://www.visualstudio.com/), [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/), [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/ide/), [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), [MATLAB](https://se.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/compiling-engine-applications-in-an-ide.html?requestedDomain=www.mathworks.com)
